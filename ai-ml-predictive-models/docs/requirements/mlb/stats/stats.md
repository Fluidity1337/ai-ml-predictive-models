batter
team
home/away, opp. pitcher, game time, ballpark factor, weather factor, batter slash, PA, BA, ISO, pitcher slash, ERA, WHIP, K-BB, HH, HR/9. That's only an example, I'd likely replace several columns with advanced/expected stats to simplify it. Random data can matter too (e.g. some players experience a lot of variance in day games, some stadiums are domed). I never decided on the context, like whether it'd be general, against that pitcher, or something moderate like when facing L/R batter/pitcher.
